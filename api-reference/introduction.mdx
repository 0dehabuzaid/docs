## Authentication

The Hamsa media-to-text APIs use <b>API Key token authentication</b>. The authentication scheme is used in the request <b>Headers</b> as follows:

```json
Authorization: Token <API Key Id>
```

To authenticate your requests, you'll need to include a valid API key token in the Authorization header. You can obtain an API key token by following the appropriate authentication flow, which is documented in the <a href="/auth">Authentication</a> section.
