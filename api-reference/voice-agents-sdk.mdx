# Hamsa Voice Agent Web SDK

**Hamsa Voice Agents Web SDK** is a JavaScript library for integrating voice agents from https://dashboard.tryhamsa.com. This SDK provides a seamless way to incorporate voice interactions into your web applications.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Utilize WebSocket for real-time communication.
- **Audio Support**: Record and playback audio effortlessly.
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for quick voice interactions.
- **Compatibility**: Works in both Node.js and browser environments.

## Installation

Install the SDK via npm:

```bash
npm i @hamsa-ai/voice-agents-sdk
```

## HamsaVoiceAgent Class And Functionality

The core of the SDK is the `HamsaVoiceAgent` class, which extends the `EventEmitter` class from Node.js. This design allows the SDK to easily handle and emit events, enabling developers to respond to various states of the voice interaction process.


## Usage

First, import the package in your code:

```javascript
import { HamsaVoiceAgent } from 'hamsa-voice-agents';
```

Initialize the SDK with your API key. 
To obtain your first API key, follow our tutorial page <a href="/create-api-keys">Here</a>:

```javascript
const agent = new HamsaVoiceAgent(API_KEY);
```

## Start a Conversation with an Existing Agent

Start a conversation with an existing agent by calling the "start" function. You can create and manage agents in our Dashboard or using our API <a href="/api-reference/endpoint/initialize-conversation">here</a>:

```javascript
agent.start({
    agentId: YOUR_AGENT_ID,
    params: {
        param1: "NAME",
        param2: "NAME2"
    }
});
```

When creating an agent, you can add parameters to your pre-defined values. For example, you can set your Greeting Message to: `"Hello {{name}}, how can I help you today?"` and pass the `"name"` as a parameter to use the correct name of the user.


## Pause/Resume a Conversation

To pause the conversation, call the `"pause"` function. This will prevent the SDK from sending or receiving new data until you resume the conversation:

```javascript
agent.pause();
```

To resume the conversation:

```javascript
agent.resume();
```


## End a Conversation

To end a conversation, simply call the `"end"` function:

```javascript
agent.end();
```

## Events

During the conversation, the SDK emits events to update your application about the conversation status.

### Conversation Status Events

```javascript
agent.on("callStarted", () => { console.log("Conversation has started!"); });
agent.on("callEnded", () => { console.log("Conversation has ended!"); });
agent.on("callPaused", () => { console.log("The conversation is paused"); });
agent.on("callResumed", () => { console.log("Conversation has resumed"); });
```

### Agent Status Events

```javascript
agent.on("speaking", () => { console.log("The agent is speaking"); });
agent.on("listening", () => { console.log("The agent is listening"); });
```

### Conversation Script Events

```javascript
agent.on("transcriptionReceived", (text) => { console.log("User speech transcription received", text); });
agent.on("answerReceived", (text) => { console.log("Agent answer received", text); });
```

### Error Events

```javascript
agent.on("closed", () => { console.log("Conversation was closed"); });
agent.on("error", (e) => { console.log("Error was received", e); });
```

### Usage Example

To use the SDK effectively, developers should follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the SDK**: Create an instance of `HamsaVoiceAgent` with the API key.
2. **Set Up Event Listeners**: Listen for events like `callStarted`, `callEnded`, `callPaused`, and `callResumed` to manage the call lifecycle.
3. **Start a Voice Call**: Invoke the `start()` method to begin the interaction.
4. **Manage the Call**: Use `pause()`, `resume()`, and `end()` methods as needed to control the flow of the conversation.


### Conclusion

The Hamsa Voice Agent Web SDK simplifies the integration of voice capabilities into web applications, offering powerful features for real-time communication. By leveraging the functionalities of the `HamsaVoiceAgent` class, developers can create engaging voice-enabled experiences with ease.
